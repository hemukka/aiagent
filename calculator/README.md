# Calculator

This is a simple calculator application that evaluates mathematical expressions.

## Usage

To use the calculator, run the `main.py` file with the expression as a command-line argument.

```bash
python main.py "<expression>"
```

**Example:**

```bash
python main.py "1 + 2 * 3"
```

**Supported operations:**

*   Addition (+)
*   Subtraction (-)
*   Multiplication (*)
*   Division (/)

The calculator uses the `pkg/calculator.py` module to evaluate the expression and `pkg/render.py` to format the output.
